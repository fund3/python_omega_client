Requirements
************

1. gcc 4.8+
2. Python3.5+
3. Access to `python_omega_client` and `TradingCommunicationProtocol` Fund3 repos.
4. A valid SSH Key on the machine or cloned python_omega_client repo.
5. For now we assume there is a symlink pointing Python versions to `python3`
and `pip3`, but that will be changed in the future to detect python versions.
